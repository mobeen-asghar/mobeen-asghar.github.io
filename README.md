Blockchain Based Land Registration and Management System - FYP


The project stems from the inherent challenges and limitations of the current land registration process. 
The manual nature of record-keeping and the lack of robust security measures have led to delays, inaccuracies, and increased risks of fraudulent activities. 
Recognizing these issues, the project aims to leverage blockchain technology to create a decentralized and tamper-proof land registry system that ensures data integrity, transparency, and efficiency. Furthermore, the use of blockchain technology will streamline the land registration process, reducing the need for manual paperwork and extensive bureaucratic procedures. 
Through automation and digitization, the system will enable efficient data entry, verification, and validation, accelerating the overall process and enhancing data accuracy.
